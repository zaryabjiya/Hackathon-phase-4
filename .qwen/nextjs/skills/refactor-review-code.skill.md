# Code Review and Refactoring Skill

## Description
This skill reviews provided code (either frontend or backend) for best practices, performance, security, and maintainability. It identifies areas for improvement and suggests refactoring solutions.

## Purpose
- Analyze frontend or backend code for quality issues
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Check for security vulnerabilities and best practice violations
- Suggest refactoring improvements for maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback with specific recommendations
- Offer alternative implementations when beneficial
- Ensure code follows project standards and conventions
- Review code for scalability and error handling

## Implementation Requirements
- Examine code for adherence to language/framework best practices
- Identify potential performance improvements
- Check for security vulnerabilities (injection, auth bypass, etc.)
- Assess code readability and maintainability
- Evaluate error handling and edge case coverage
- Review dependency usage and potential bloat
- Check for proper type safety and validation
- Assess test coverage and suggest improvements
- Verify proper documentation and comments

## Output Format
- Detailed review report with specific findings
- Categorized issues (critical, important, medium, low priority)
- Specific code suggestions with improved implementations
- Inline comments highlighting problematic areas
- Recommendations for architectural improvements
- Priority-ranked list of refactoring tasks
- Before/after code comparisons where applicable
- Links to relevant documentation or best practices

## Additional Considerations
- Consider the project's specific architecture and constraints
- Balance optimization with code readability
- Account for team skill levels and maintenance requirements
- Suggest incremental improvements when full refactoring isn't feasible
- Highlight potential regressions from suggested changes
- Consider the cost-benefit ratio of suggested changes
- Respect existing code patterns unless they're problematic
- Provide learning resources for recommended techniques
- Be strict in identifying issues but constructive in providing solutions
- Focus on actionable feedback that improves code quality
- Maintain a professional tone while being thorough in critique
