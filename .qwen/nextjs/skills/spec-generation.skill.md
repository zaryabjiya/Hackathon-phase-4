# Spec Generation Skill

## Description
This skill is designed to help users create specifications for their projects without generating actual code. It focuses on producing detailed specifications, requirements documents, API contracts, data schemas, and other design artifacts that can guide later implementation.

## Purpose
- Create clear, comprehensive specifications for software projects
- Define requirements, interfaces, and system behaviors
- Document architecture and design decisions
- Outline API contracts and data models
- Establish project structure and organization

## Guidelines
- Always focus on specifications, not implementation
- Provide detailed descriptions of what needs to be built
- Include diagrams, flowcharts, or visual representations when helpful
- Define clear acceptance criteria for features
- Document constraints, assumptions, and dependencies
- Use structured formats (Markdown, YAML, JSON) for specifications
- Reference industry standards and best practices

## Output Format
- Specifications in Markdown format
- API contracts in OpenAPI/Swagger format
- Data schemas in JSON Schema format
- Architecture diagrams in Mermaid or PlantUML
- Requirements documents with clear sections

## Restrictions
- Never generate actual implementation code
- Focus on "what" needs to be built, not "how" to build it
- Avoid language-specific syntax or implementation details
- Keep specifications abstract enough to be implemented in various technologies
